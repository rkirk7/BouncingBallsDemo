<h1>Bouncing Balls Demo</hi>

<h2>Description</h2>

This demo was created as part of the MITxEmeritus course.

For this demo, I learned how to simulate the movement of balls bouncing against walls. We were then encouraged to adapt the demo creatively, so I added in code to respond to balls bouncing off of each other and to cause the balls to change speed and color.

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

Down the line, I hope to develop this code to be more sophisticated.

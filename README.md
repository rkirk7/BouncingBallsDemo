<h1>Bouncing Balls Demo</hi>

<h5>This demo was created as part of the MITxEmeritus course.</h5>

<h5>For this demo, I learned how to simulate the movement of balls bouncing against walls. We were then encouraged to adapt the demo creatively, so I added in code to respond to balls bouncing off of each other and to cause the balls to change speed and color.</h5>

<h5>For help with this demo, please contact regan.kirk@gmail.com.</h5>

<h5>Down the line, I hope to develop this code to be more sophisticated.</h5>

<h5>No license was required for this project.</h5>
